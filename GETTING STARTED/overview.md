gno.land is a Layer 1 blockchain platform that enables the execution of Smart Contracts using an interpreted version of the GO language called Gno.

### Why gno.land is Go-Based

The choice to use Go for gno.land is based on two main reasons:

1. **Reliable and Secure**: Go is a well-known and trusted programming language. By using it, gno.land is built on a solid and secure foundation.
2. **User-Friendly**: Go is simple and beginner-friendly. This makes it simpler for more developers to create Smart Contracts on the gno.land platform.

## Tendermint2 Indexer

gno.land provides a tool called `tx-indexer` that helps organize and access data from Tendermint2 blockchains. This tool makes it easy to find and retrieve transactions and block data in two ways:

- [GraphQL Endpoints](/reference-graphql-api)
- [JSON-RPC Endpoints](/reference/rpc-api)
