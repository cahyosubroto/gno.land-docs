In this use case, we will retrieve all blocks created within the specific time range. This will allow you to analyze the block creation frequency and transaction volume during that period.

## Sample Request

```graphql
query {
  blocks(filter: { from_time: "2024-08-01T00:00:00Z", to_time: "2024-08-01T12:00:00Z" }) {
    hash
    height
    time
    num_txs
    total_txs
  }
}

```

## Sample Response

```json
{
  "data": {
    "blocks": [
      {
        "hash": "kADxL3doJ5B+VZmY8GWnpvhgFsFMlyMySIiat4heYsY=",
        "height": 508499,
        "time": "2024-08-01T00:00:23.381070565Z",
        "num_txs": 0,
        "total_txs": 9660
      },
      {
