In this use case, we will retrieve all blocks within the specific block heights, along with each block's hash, height, version, chain ID, time of creation, and the number of transactions in it.

## Sample Request

```graphql
query {
  blocks(filter: { from_height: 100, to_height: 105 }) {
    hash
    height
    version
    chain_id
    time
    num_txs
    total_txs
  }
}

```

## Sample Response
